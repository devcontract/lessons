# X Y generator


As we know, 'Math.random()' returns numbers between 0 and 1. 
So the minimum number it will return is 0. 
Now if a number is multiplied with 0 (diff here), 
it will be 0. Adding the starting range to 0 will give the 
starting number itself.

Now, the maximum number randomly generated will be 1. 
If this is multiplied with difference, it will result difference. 
Now adding this difference to starting range, 
will give out nothing but the end range. Simple maths, right? 
Likewise, the maths goes for all the floating numbers between 0 to 1.
